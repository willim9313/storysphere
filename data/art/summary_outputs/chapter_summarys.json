    "summary": "Old Major, a respected boar, gathers the animals of Manor Farm to share his dream and wisdom, foretelling his death. He argues that their miserable lives stem from human exploitation, where humans consume without producing, stealing the fruits of animal labor, and leading to cruel deaths. He urges rebellion, advocating for animal unity against humans, teaching them the song \"Beasts of England\" about a future where animals are free and equal. The animals embrace the song, creating a ruckus that awakens Mr. Jones, who fires a shot, dispersing them. Major emphasizes enmity towards Man and warns against adopting human vices, advocating for equality and prohibiting animals from harming each other. He wants them to pass on the message to future generations.",

    "summary": "After Major's death, pigs (Snowball, Napoleon, Squealer) secretly planned the Rebellion, systematizing his ideas into Animalism, facing resistance due to loyalty to Mr. Jones or concerns about survival. The pigs taught Animalism, singing 'Beasts of England' at clandestine meetings. The Rebellion erupted prematurely due to Mr. Jones's neglect and drunkenness, leading to the animals' hunger and revolt. The pigs struggled to convince all animals; some were apathetic, focused on immediate needs, or questioned the rebellion's value. Mollie feared losing luxuries, while Moses spread tales of Sugarcandy Mountain, which the pigs refuted. Boxer and Clover became the pigs' dedicated followers, promoting Animalism.",
